ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK THE INTERNET TO BE SURE THAT THE METHODS YOU'RE USING ARE STANDARD AND UP-TO-DATE FOR MINECRAFT/FABRIC 1.21.10. THIS IS BECAUSE A LOT CHANGED IN MINECRAFT 1.21+
I'm fairly new to coding. Please simplify your answers to accomidate, then provide brief explanations as to what the more technical side of it means.
Use data/<modid>/recipe/ (singular). Do not keep duplicates under data/<modid>/recipes/.-
After editing resources, restart the dev client (or run gradlew processResources and relaunch). /reload does not rebuild mod resources.
Fabric 1.21 needs a little “item asset” stub in assets/<modid>/items/ for every item that should use a model.
